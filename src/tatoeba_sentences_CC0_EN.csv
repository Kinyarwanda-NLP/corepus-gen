May the Lord repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."	2019-06-08 16:44:25

7965839	eng	At meal time Boaz said to her, "Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar."	2019-06-08 16:44:59
7965840	eng	She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.

Let her glean, and don‚Äôt rebuke her."	2019-06-08 16:45:30

Behold, he will be winnowing barley tonight on the threshing floor. Therefore wash yourself, anoint yourself, get dressed, and go down to the threshing floor; but don‚Äôt make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall note the place where he is lying. Then you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lay down. Then he will tell you what to do."	2019-06-09 01:02:56
7966799	eng	She said to her, "All that you say, I will do." She went down to the threshing floor, and did everything that her mother-in-law told her.

At midnight, the man was startled and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet. He said, "Who are you?"	2019-06-09 01:03:38
7966800	eng	She answered, "I am Ruth your servant. Therefore spread the corner of your garment over your servant; for you are a near kinsman."	2019-06-09 01:04:02
7966801	eng	He said, "You are blessed by the Lord, my daughter. You have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, because you didn‚Äôt follow young men, whether poor or rich. Now, my daughter, don‚Äôt be afraid. I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people knows that you are a worthy woman. Now it is true that I am a near kinsman. However, there is a kinsman nearer than I. Stay this night, and in the morning, if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman, good. Let him do the kinsman's duty. But if he will not do the duty of a kinsman for you, then I will do the duty of a kinsman for you, as the Lord lives. Lie down until the morning."	2019-06-09 01:04:53
7966802	eng	She lay at his feet until the morning, then she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor." He said, "Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it." She held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; then he went into the city.	2019-06-09 01:05:27
7966803	eng	When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, "How did it go, my daughter?"	2019-06-09 01:05:44

7966805	eng	Then she said, "Wait, my daughter, until you know what will happen; for the man will not rest until he has settled this today."	2019-06-09 01:06:26
7966807	eng	Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by. Boaz said to him, "Come over here, friend, and sit down!" He came over, and sat down.	2019-06-09 01:07:10
7966808	eng	Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, "Sit down here," and they sat down.	2019-06-09 01:08:21
7966810	eng	He said to the near kinsman, "Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's. I thought I should tell you, saying, 'Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.' If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you; and I am after you."	2019-06-09 01:08:24
7966811	eng	He said, "I will redeem it."	2019-06-09 01:08:49

7966815	eng	The near kinsman said, "I can't redeem it for myself, lest I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can't redeem it."	2019-06-09 01:09:38
7966816	eng	Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his sandal, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of formalizing transactions in Israel. So the near kinsman said to Boaz, "Buy it for yourself," then he took off his sandal.	2019-06-09 01:10:04
7966817	eng	Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, "You are witnesses today, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi. Moreover, Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today."	2019-06-09 01:10:50
7966819	eng	All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, "We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which both built the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem. Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the offspring which the Lord will give you by this young woman."	2019-06-09 01:11:20
7966821	eng	So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she bore a son. The women said to Naomi, "Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you today without a near kinsman. Let his name be famous in Israel. He shall be to you a restorer of life and sustain you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him." Naomi took the child, laid him in her bosom, and became nurse to him. The women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, "A son is born to Naomi". They named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.	2019-06-09 01:12:49
7966823	eng	Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron, and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon, and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed, and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.	2019-06-09 01:13:17
